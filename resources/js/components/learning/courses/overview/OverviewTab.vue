      JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development,
      among many other things. It works in conjunction with HTML and CSS to add
      dynamic functionality to websites. JavaScript is the sauce of the web. It
      is what makes things dance. JavaScript enables web pages to do things like
      display updated content, show maps that you can interact with, and many
      other things.

      How to Practice Coding in JavaScript
    </div>
    <p class="text-muted mb-2">
      Practicing is what makes you progress. Whether it's in music, dancing,
      singing, playing basketball – or coding.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Practicing is really repetitive and can be tiring, but it is what helps us
      and sets us apart in the long run. It is through the action of practicing
      and repetition that we are able to be good at all these activities. Coding
      is not different.

      Courses and tutorials are a good way to learn. You can find various

      take a course on a particular programming language, you can find them on
      sites like LinkedIn.
